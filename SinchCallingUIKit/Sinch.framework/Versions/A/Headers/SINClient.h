/**
 * The SINClient is the Sinch SDK entry point.
 *
 * It provides access to the feature classes in the Sinch SDK:
 * SINMessageClient, SINCallClient and SINAudioController.
 * It is also used to configure the user's and device's capabilities.
 *
 * ### User Identification
 *
 * The user IDs that are used to identify users application specific.
 * If the app already has a scheme for user IDs (email addresses,
 * phone numbers, customer numbers, etc.), the same ID could be used
 * when configuring the SINClient.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * 	// Instantiate a client object using the client factory.
 * 	id<SINClient> sinchClient = [Sinch clientWithApplicationKey:@"<APPKEY>"
 * 	                                          applicationSecret:@"<APPSECRET>"
 * 	                                            environmentHost:@"clientapi.sinch.com"
 * 	                                                     userId:@"<USERID>"];
 *
 * 	// Specify the client capabilities. At least one of the messaging or calling capabilities should be enabled.
 * 	[sinchClient setSupportCalling:YES];
 * 	[sinchClient setSupportMessaging:YES];
 * 	[sinchClient setSupportActiveConnectionInBackground:YES]; // (optional)
 * 	[sinchClient setSupportPushNotifications:YES]; // (optional)
 *
 * 	// Set your delegate object
 * 	sinchClient.delegate = ... ;
 *
 * 	// Start the client
 * 	[sinchClient start];
 *
 * 	// Start listening for incoming events (calls and messages).
 * 	[sinchClient startListeningOnActiveConnection];
 *
 * 	// Use the SINCallClient to place and receive calls
 * 	// Use the SINMessageClient  to send and receive messages
 *
 * 	// Stop listening for incoming events (calls and messages).
 * 	[sinchClient stopListeningOnActiveConnection];
 *
 * 	// Terminate the client when the calling and messaging functionalities are no longer needed.
 * 	[sinchClient terminate];
